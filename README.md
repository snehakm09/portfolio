# Projects

# Flight fare prediction: 
•	Developed a robust predictive model using Python and machine learning algorithms to accurately forecast flight fares based on historical data. 
•	Employed techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to optimize performance and ensure reliable predictions. 
•	Successfully implemented various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train and evaluate the predictive model. 
•	Utilized cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

# Prediction of Acute Hypotensive Episodes in ICU patients: 
•	Developed a deep learning model using Python and TensorFlow to predict Acute Hypotensive Episodes in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients by analyzing PPG (Photoplethysmography) signals. 
•	Conducted extensive research and data preprocessing to extract meaningful features from raw PPG signal data and feature engineering techniques to improve the quality and relevance of input variables. 
•	Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities in identifying and addressing challenges related to data quality, feature extraction, and model optimization.

# Prediction of fraudulent transactions: 
•	Explored and gained comprehensive insights into transactional data to effectively predict fraudulent transactions through the application of Frequent Pattern Mining using the Apriori Growth algorithm.
•	Contributed to the enhancement of fraud detection systems by leveraging Frequent Pattern Mining techniques to identify hidden relationships and anomalies within transactional data, thus minimizing financial losses and strengthening security measures.

# Formula1 sports analysis: 
•	Applied regression analysis techniques and utilized ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) modeling to conduct in-depth analysis of Formula 1 sports data. 
•	Conducted ANOVA modeling to assess the significance of different factors on race outcomes, providing valuable insights into the relative importance of each variable.

# Airbnb dashboard using Tableau:
•	Developed a user-friendly Airbnb dashboard using Tableau, enabling efficient data visualization and analysis of rental property performance metrics. 
•	Implemented interactive filters and visualizations to facilitate data-driven decision-making for property owners and managers.
